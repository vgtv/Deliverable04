        <h2>F.A.Q</h2>  
            <p><strong>Q: Does Able cost money?</strong>  <br/>
                A: No, Able is free of charge and commercial free.
            </p>

            <p><strong>
                Q: Are Able only for people with disabilities?

                A: No, we want as many as possible to contribute to
                our community. Together we can be more aware, and make  Oslo safe and available for people with physical

                Q: How does Able know my location when I want to post a message and/or picture about a problem?

                 A: If you have tracking enabled on your device, Able will automatically track your current location when you
